A simple expression parser based on a version I wrote over 37 years ago in Z80 assembly.
It is a work in progress, but it supports variables ( starting from 'a', 'b', 'c'... ) and operator precedence.
It uses one stack for the values and other for the operators.
It is appropriated for the PIC microcontrollers because it doesn't use recursion.
